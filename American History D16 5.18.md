_Secondary:_ [Brinkley, pp.138-140](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15-IjkQ74b63BtbPI6xnxEc4M4vnry78n/view?usp=sharing)  
_Primary_: [[Excerpts from Federalists]]

Problems that the constitution faced
- Anti-federalist critiques
	- not defending the natural rights
		- solution: [[Bill of Rights]]


Federalists - defenders of [[The Constitution]]

**What were the issues in the ratification debate?** 
- Some states wanted a [[Bill of Rights]] to protect states and individual liberties/rights
- They didn't want the centralized, federal government gaining too much power and strength
- [[The constitution]] left things very vague
	- the restrictions/rules on courts were not really present

**Did the powers granted to the national government under the proposed Constitution pose a threat to individual liberty and the rights of the states?** 
- without a bill of rights, anti-federalists thought the constitution violated individual rights because they would not be protected without the specific enumeration of them
- the goal of the constitution was to move away from individualized power and shift towards a more centralized government system which could have possibly taken some of the individual power that the states had away from them

**Why does Madison argue that the Constitution will solve problems that the Articles could not ameliorate?** 
- The constitution is meant to provide more power to the central government. The government had the ability to enforce various laws that were passed. However, Madison argued that the new system created faction but that these faction meant to enable freedom of speech. In the old system of Articles of Confederation, legislators were only in one house and this was altered by the constitution. Splitting the legislative branch into two houses allowed more representatives and more freedom of speech. More ideas led to more laws passed and thus more power to Congress
- Articles of confederation did not address separation of power and the constitution did
- The Federalist paper talk a log about how 

**How does he define factions and why does he believe they are a threat to the nation's stability?** 
Definition of a faction:
- People who are “united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.”
- Factions are caused by a “zeal for different opinions concerning religion, concerning government, and many other points, as well as speculation of practice.” (natural differences among people) 

Possible causes of a faction include:
- Unequal distribution of property, leaving the debtor separate from the creditors
    
Why are they a threat:
- When a harmful faction includes the majority, simply putting questions to a vote endangers the individual rights of the minority 
- The public good is disregarded in the conflicts of rival parties 
- Measures are decided not according to the rules of justice
- If a disruptful/harmful faction gets large enough, and the state is a pure democracy, they could take over and make certain rules that are only beneficial to themselves
	- Not checks and balances
	    
**In what ways does a republic differ from a “pure” democracy, according to Madison?** 
- Protects the minority group's rights
- Madison argues that a republic prevents a majority view from always taking over a country, compared to a “pure democracy”. In a democracy, the majority can also try to take advantage of the minority and put their rights at risk for their own benefit. Madison’s ideal government includes having elected representatives that voice the opinions of the public. This prevents a majority opinion from controlling every decision made, and this form of government allows multiple opinions to be represented equally.
    

**How and why has the Constitution emerged as an aspect of American national consciousness and reverence?** 
American national conciseness
- national consciousness is the 

Reverence
- deep respect

- articles of confederation failed to the power individual of states, the US didn't have that unity or togetherness
- as a solution, the constitution put more power with the federal government
- federalist 10 claims that the republic that the constitution proposes will help lessen the oppression and problems of factions. More unity with peace
- federalist paper paints representatives as patriotic, loving justice and wanted the best for the country. Compelling people by saying they prevent the pitfalls f direct democracy. So support the constitution for the common, public good
