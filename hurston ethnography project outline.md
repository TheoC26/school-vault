#### premise
- I am walking out for school but running a little late
- I call the elevator button before putting on my shoes because the elevator takes so long
- I sit down on the bench and start putting on my shoes, trying to finish before the elevator reaches 9 
- I hear people talking, the voices of my neighbors
	- they speak very loudly
- Charlie's mom is yelling at him to fix his hair, while at the same time opening the door and realizing I am sitting there, frantically putting getting my things together
- she is comically in her robe, and smiles at me and says hi, awkwardly while handing Charlie his daily bagged apples
- he walks out in his suit, penny loafers, and herschel backpack eyeing me in disgust for my unreadiness
- the elevator finally comes and I grab my bag, one of my shoes still untied
- we both get in the elevator silently
