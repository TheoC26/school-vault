# Shay's Rebellion 

## what was it
- Farmers more in debt, getting desperate because they can't pay taxes
- armed rebellion seemed the only option

## when was it
- happened during a time when America was incredibly disorganized
	- no organized garbage collection in NY
	- government had no power of money
	- no foreign relations
	- little money so reliant on bartering
- August 29, 1786

## why did it happen
- concerns of farmers
	- lack of money supply
	- crippling debts
	- unfair treatment by authorities
		- e.g. suspension of [[habeas corpus]]
	- farmers have taken loans, but do not have means to pay it back
	- [[pro creditor]] (Boston)
		- the one giving the loan
		- the bank or wealthy individuals
	- [[pro debtor]] (farmers in western mass)
		- the one that took out the loan
		- farmers/lower class 
- student debt debate
	- if they forgive debt, they are allowing for the debtors to stimulate the economy

- does Massachusetts suspension of [[habeas corpus]] represent a functioning government?
	- what is motivating this decision

## who was involved
- there were 1800 men ready to overthrow the government
