## thoughts about the day / what i did:
- It is beautiful out and my knee is feeling much better
- I am playing tennis with Igor for the first time since I hurt it and I am super excited
- we came up to O.G. today early for Timmy's football practice and I have kept working on my obsidian
- I played a lot on the lawn and my knee somehow doesn't hurt at all!
	- i might be able to play tennis by the end of the season
