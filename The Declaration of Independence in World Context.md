## author
[[Armitage]]

## what is it

- **overall idea**
	- rights of the states vs. rights of the individuals
	- we tend to focus on the declaration of independence as a proclamation as the rights of individuals but it is actually a proclamation of the rights of the states.

- **Armitage's primary motivation**
	- he wants to "internationalize" American history
		- additional context
		- establish/identify patterns and themes across a variety of countries, revolutions, societies, etc.
		- american history does not exist in a vacuum
			- contra(go against) narratives of Armitage exceptionalism 

- **primary goal**
	- not to just express the Lockean rights
	- formal declaration of independence
	- rebellious colonies of B.E. -> legitimate belligerents in a war as sovereign nation-state
	- "United States of America"
		- transnational community of British Empire -> international community of sovereign states
