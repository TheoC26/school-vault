Significance between the first map and the second map
Significance on indians and their land

Mostly colonizers doing the fighting
British wanted the land because it would make them be able to trade more with the colonizers thus making them more money

The french were not doing that much with the land
Millions of people died
Pillaging , raids
Deportation of french from main to Louisiana
Wars are expensive
Britain got into a lot of debt and they decided the colonists should pay for it so they raised their taxes and made things like the stamp act
The taxes are what made the colonists angry and that is what fueled the revolutionary war 

British gained power by getting more land which in turn made them loose all that land to an even greater power

## what is the significance between the first map and the second map
Between the years 1756 and 1763, the Seven Years War took place. Although this war involved multiple countries for different reasons, one of the largest conflicts was between Britain and France. Britain still had control of the colonies, but wanted more land in North America. They were making a lot of money through trade with the colonies, so more land would let the population grow, thus creating a higher demand for trade. The British started looking towards the Frenchâ€™s land to the west of the Colonies. With all of their land, however, the French mostly used it for trading posts. The British went to war with the French, taking much of their territory. The soldiers fighting were mostly colonists with very few British soldiers. Additionally, the Native Americans joined the battles, mostly helping the French. The French had better bonds with the natives because of their small settlements and kindness towards them while converting them to Christianity. Although the British came out victorious, there were many repercussions for everyone involved. The British gathered large amounts of debt because of the war, and decided to make the colonists pay for it. They raised the taxes, implementing systems including the stamp act. It was these raises in taxation that sparked the retaliation of the colonists, leading to the Revolutionary War. Additionally, the Native Americans lost much of their land to the British. Because of their different views on ownership, the British took and settled upon native owned land, depleting their population. In the end, the British gained power by acquiring more land which in turn led them to lose all that land to an even greater power which they created.
