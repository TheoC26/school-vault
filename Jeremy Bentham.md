# Jeremy Bentham 

## overview


## what did they do

### quote
In responding to the Declaration of Independence, conservative British politician (and moral philosopher) Jeremy Bentham vehemently criticized the American colonists’ theory of government in his 1776 “Short Review,” stating:

> “The rights of ‘life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness’ -- by which, if they (the colonists) mean anything, they must mean the right to enjoy life, to enjoy liberty, and to pursue happiness –they ‘hold to be unalienable.’ This they ‘hold to be among truths self-evident.’ At the same time, to secure these rights, they are content that Governments should be instituted. They perceive not, or will not seem to perceive, that nothing which can be called Government ever was, or ever could be, in any instance, exercised, but at the expense of one or other of those rights. – That, consequently, in as many instances as Government is ever exercised, some one or other of these rights, pretended to be unalienable, is actually alienated.”

**meaning**
- for a government to work you need to give away some rights to get some level of organization
- do our rights exist independent of government's ability to enforce/protect them
