# first draft


I am so late! I quickly grab my bag, step in my shoes and head for the door. I press the elevator button and sit down on the bench to tie my shoes. Why did I not get out of bed just five minutes earlier? Hearing the voices of my neighbors, I silently pray for the ancient elevator to come quicker. Their door opens, and I jam my AirPods in my ear, hoping to drown out the Charlie's mom yelling at him to fix his hair. She pulls open the door, revealing her robed self, slyly handing Charlie his apple slices.

"Oh um, good morning", she mumbles to me, "have a fine day at school". 

I respond, "thanks" but keep tying my shoes, trying to make as little contact with the awkward pair as possible. Looking up, I see Charlie in his usual suit, penny loafers, and Herschel backpack, eyeing me in disgust for my unreadiness. 

The elevator finally comes and Charlie and I hurry in, pressing "1" and door close at the same time. Unfortunately, the elevator goes up, my worst nightmare. We could be heading on an adventure to every stinking floor in the entire building. I am going to be years late for school at this point. We both stare at the numbers above the elevator's sliding door, watching them go up at an astronomically slow rate. 

Realizing that we are going to have a long ride, I attempt conversation. "Hey! How's the family?".

He looks at his feet and I can hardly make out the words, "fine" escape his mouth. The door opens on 13, and in walks Jill, a women that looks like she is in her 80s.
