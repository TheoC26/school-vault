# first draft


I am so late! I quickly grab my bag, step in my shoes and head for the door. I press the elevator button and sit down on the bench to tie my shoes. Why did I not get out of bed just five minutes earlier? Hearing the voices of my neighbors, I silently pray for the ancient elevator to come quicker. Their door opens, and I jam my AirPods in my ear, hoping to drown out the Charlie's mom yelling at him to fix his hair. She pulls open the door, revealing her robed self, slyly handing Charlie his apple slices.

"Oh um, good morning", she mumbles to me, "have a fine day at school". 

I respond, "thanks" but keep tying my shoes, trying to make as little contact with the awkward pair as possible. Looking up, I see Charlie in his usual suit, penny loafers, and Herschel backpack, eyeing me in disgust for my unreadiness. 

The elevator finally comes and Charlie and I hurry in, pressing "1" and door close at the same time. Unfortunately, the elevator goes up, my worst nightmare. We could be heading on an adventure to every stinking floor in the entire building. I am going to be years late for school at this point. We both stare at the numbers above the elevator's sliding door, watching them go up at an astronomically slow rate. 

Realizing that we are going to have a long ride, I attempt conversation. "Hey! How's the family?".

He looks at his feet and I can hardly make out the words, "fine" escape his mouth. The door slides open on 13, and in walks Jill, a woman that looks like she is in her late 80s. 

"Good morning, young fellows! Where are we off to today?" she croaks out, oblivious to our backpacks and that this is the time of day that every kid goes to school. 

"I am heading to school" I respond, "I'm a little late though". 

"That is okay, we all have our little setbacks that keep us from our larger goals, am I right? What class are you heading too?". The elevator couldn't move any slower. 

"Biology" I say with a forced smile. The elevator slows to a stop at 10. The most hideous colored hallway meets my eyes through the door opening, standing in it with a calm, serene look is a man I have never seen before. He looks to be in his older 20s with long curly hair and sandals. 

"Whats up Charlie! Whats goin on?" He walks in and gives me a small upwards nod, a gesture more for formality than friendliness. 

- make this guy super talkative
