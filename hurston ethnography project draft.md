# first draft


I am so late! I quickly grab my bag, step in my shoes and head for the door. I press the elevator button and sit down on the bench to tie my shoes. Why did I not get out of bed just five minutes earlier? Hearing the voices of my neighbors, I silently pray for the ancient elevator to come quicker. Their door opens, and I jam my AirPods in my ear, hoping to drown out Jonah's mom yelling at him to fix his hair. She pulls open the door, revealing her robed self, slyly handing Jonah his apple slices.

"Oh um, good morning", she mumbles to me, "have a fine day at school". 

I respond, "Thanks," but keep tying my shoes, trying to make as little contact with the awkward pair as possible. Looking up, I see Jonah in his usual suit, penny loafers, and Herschel backpack, eyeing me in disgust for my unreadiness. 

The elevator finally comes and Jonah and I hurry in, pressing "1" and "door close" at the same time. Unfortunately, the elevator goes up, my worst nightmare. We could be heading on an adventure to every stinking floor in the entire building. I am going to be years late for school at this point. We both stare at the numbers above the elevator's sliding door, watching them go up at an astronomically slow rate. 

Realizing that we are going to have a long ride, I attempt conversation. "Hey! How's the family?"

He looks at his feet and I can hardly make out the word, "fine" escape his mouth. The door slides open on 13, and in walks Jill, a woman who looks like she is in her late 80s. 

"Good morning, young fellows! Where are we off to today?" she croaks out, oblivious to our backpacks and that this is the time of day that every kid goes to school. 

"I am heading to school," I respond, "I'm a little late though". 

"That is okay, we all have our little setbacks that keep us from our larger goals, am I right? What class are you heading to?". The elevator couldn't move any slower. 

"Biology," I say with a forced smile. The elevator slows to a stop at 10. The most hideous colored hallway meets my eyes through the door opening, standing in it with a calm, serene look is a man I have never seen before. He looks to be in his older 20s with long curly hair and sandals. 

"What's up Jonah! What's goin on?" He walks in and gives me a small upwards nod, a gesture more of formality than friendliness. 

"Hey Joey…" His Jonah's head stays looking at the carpet, as though he was looking for something. Something to make time move quicker. 

"Biology!? Did you know I was a Science teacher for 41 years?" She continues, completely ignoring the other conversation going on in the elevator, "I taught every class there is. If you ever need help, just come a knockin'!" Of course I know she was a biology teacher. Every time I see her, she finds a way to bring it up. She has offered me bio text books, notes, contacts; she has offered me just about everything to do with Biology. 

"What grade are you in?" She asks as though I have never told her before. Short term memory loss can be such a pain. 

"I am a freshman." The elevator is going back up now. Perfect. Just perfect.

"You're a freshman? That's rad dude. I dropped out of school then. Went on to dial in my influencer skills, if you know what I mean… Jonah, you're a freshman too, right?" 

Before he has a chance to respond, the door opens. Who else will have the pleasure of joining this already way too crowded elevator? As the elevator door slowly makes its way across, we realize nobody is even there. Why does everybody do this? If you are gonna take the elevator, take the frickin elevator!

I reach for the "door close" button, shaving a whopping 6 seconds off this elevator speed run. 

"Wasn't this the apartment that people kept hearing noises from during the night? I'm pretty sure it was 21B." From the smirk on his face while he talks, you can tell Joey loves drama. On our apartment Facebook, people constantly complain about scratching and knocking noises on the upper floors. Most people have different theories, but many have come to the conclusion that it is coming from Mr. Buford's apartment. He has no way of knowing these accusations, however, because he is not on Facebook. 

"I don't think it is him" insists Vanessa. "You know, I taught him back when he was in 8th grade. He is not the type of guy to be doing anything loud during the night. I would have been able to tell."

**There is no way she knows this guy. She isn't the sharpest tool in the shed anymore I guess. I am also baffled that she has Facebook and knows what is going on in the building. I don't even have Facebook.** My parents filled my siblings and I in on this spectacle last night. Through my amazement, I reply, "Sometimes I do hear the noises all the way down on 9, but it does sound like it's coming from upstairs." I never participate in elevator discussions. The boredom of this excruciatingly long elevator must have gotten to me. 

"It's' def him" Joey insists. "I was in the elevator with him yesterday, and he seemed like the type of guy to just hit random stuff really loud out of nowhere. He must have changed a lot since 8th grade." He grins even bigger, knowing the ridiculousness of his statement. "What do you think, Jonah?"

Jonah is back to staring at the numbers, still in his corner, sweating profusely. He gets extremely nervous around anyone outside his family. Following his gaze, I find numbers still heading up, just passing 25.

His eyes dart back to the ground, "I don't know, I haven't heard it." I barely make out his tiny voice. His awkwardness makes Joey smile. It seems that he is just trying to make Jonah uncomfortable at this point. Before I can think of this for long, however, Irene rushes in and jams her thumb into the "door close" button. Unfortunately for her, she isn't getting anywhere anytime soon at the rate we are going. 

"Hey!" we all say in unison, welcoming our new guest. Irene is short and perky, with big curly hair, and well known in our building; not for anything in particular though, just known. She seems to always be around, and knows everyone well.

"What are your thoughts on the midnight noises?" Joey inquires. I guess we are getting everyone's input now. 

"You guys don't know?"" She chuckles softly. "We had a talk with Mr. Buford yesterday and got it all sorted out. I guess we forgot to update everyone."

At this point, everyone has no choice but to be interested. Looking at her with intrigue, I exclaim, "What is it?"

"It is kind of a long story but is seams like we have plenty of time this morning... I'll tell you from the beginning. About three years ago, Buford retired from his scientific research studies, looking at bird communication. Upon leaving his lab, he could not bare to leave behind the subjects that he had grown so fond of, so he brought them home with him. Because of this building's no bird policy, his main goal was to keep them a secret, quietly smuggling them in one at a time. When two other people in the building and I questioned him yesterday, he finally revealed his story. We could tell his true passion and connection to the beautiful creatures, so we decided to keep this information from the building owners. It is the upper floor's secret but now I guess I am telling it to you. You do understand that this is confidential information and you mustn't tell anybody."

"Everyone who knows is meeting tonight at his apartment to help him come up with an idea to conceal his birds." And at that moment the doors open at the lobby, free at last. We all looked up at each other, nodded, and hurried off the elevator.
