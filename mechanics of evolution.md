# mechanics of evolution 

## what is it
There are four mechanics:
- [[gene flow]]
	- the flow of genes between populations
- [[mutation]]
	- the changing of the structure of a gene, resulting in a variant form that may be transmitted to subsequent generations, caused by the alteration of single base units in DNA, or the deletion, insertion, or rearrangement of larger sections of genes or chromosomes
- [[genetic drift]]
	- change in the frequency of an existing gene variant in a population due to random chance
- [[natural selection]]
	- the process through which populations of living organisms adapt and change
	- the process by which organisms with variations most suited to their local environment survive and are able to pass down those traits to offspring
