An argument for [[mercantilism]] in france 


## analysis
- Assumptions
	- commerce/trade is a [[zero-sum game]]
	- Colbert is concerned that France is importing too much and not exporting enough
	- This stifles domestic industry
	- Money is leaving the french empire to pay foreign merchants
	- Solution
		- Government intervention into economy
		- minimize/disincentivize foreign imports
	- Tariff - tax imports
	- Autarky (connection back to Hakluyt source
	- Econ self-sufficient
	- The colony can only tradewith the mother country
		- Comparative advantage
	- If France can create a product more efficiently than importing can, they should do it
