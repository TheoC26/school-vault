#### evidence for evolution

- development - homologous structures and embryology
- dna homology
- biogeography
- fossils

Analogous feature 
- biological features/structures that do the same thing and have evolved from different ancestors (eg. bats and bird wings)

Embryology
- all vertebrate embryos have gill slits and a tail during early development

dna homology
- similar dna

biogeography

fossils
- things were alive before

general principleds
- selection is dependent on the environment
- if environmental conditions change, selective pressure can change!!

**adaptation is not on purpose!** 
organisms do not actively try to adap
selection does not give organisms what they need
