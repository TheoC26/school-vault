## overview
**LITERATURE**
The works we will read span hundreds of years and several different genres—novel, short story, drama, religious mythology, and autobiography. Our texts will include _Persepolis_ by Marjane Satrapi, _When the Emperor Was Divine_ by Julie Otsuka, Frederick Douglass’ autobiographical _Narrative_ (with some Biblical stories for context), Mary Shelley's _Frankenstein_, and more.

Everything we read will force us to question matters that we might take for granted: in particular, the overarching and crucial issue of what it means to be human. We will ask this question both about particular places and time periods, and more generally--can we and should we establish a common sense of humanity across place and time?

**COMPOSITION**

You will write frequently, both graded and ungraded assignments. On the graded end, you will have in-class and take-home writing, some of which will have a creative option. I will be giving you regular feedback on your work, including issues like developing a strong argument, finding and using textual evidence effectively, and structuring an essay persuasively. We will spend time as needed on pragmatic “housekeeping” issues like vocabulary, grammar, and usage, including periodic quizzes if I sense that they are necessary.
