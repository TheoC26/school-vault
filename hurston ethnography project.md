# hurston ethnography project 
## [instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15g5EVGEKa8gQADNOHqclKGC3MB-VGygGOC-mMBdxaz8/edit)


## ideas
- I am _stuck_ in the elevator with a couple different people
	- they are all super quirky 
- we start off having small talk but then move on to a more serious topic:
	- the doorman's departure
		- he is leaving because of an emergency and so we all decide to do something for him
	- we brainstorm ideas for it
